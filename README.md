👋 Hi, I’m Jim Boyle (@boylejj). 

🏢 I am a Product Manager at GitHub focusing on GitHub Enterprise, where I am responsible for our audit log functionality.

☢️ Prior to joining GitHub, I worked as a product manager for Westinghouse Electric Company's nuclear physics software.

🤓 I earned my MS in Engineering & Technology Innovation Management (E&TIM) from Carnegie Mellon University, and my BS in Mechanical Engineering from Vanderbilt University.

🏡 Outside of work, I am married to my best friend, Carly, and we're raising our fiercly smart and funny 3 year old daughter.
